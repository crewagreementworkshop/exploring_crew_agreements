This two-part series of workshops will explore the collections of Crew Agreements and Official Logs archived in Newfoundland and the United Kingdom. These maritime documents record important information about the domestic, colonial, and foreign seafarers aboard British ships. Crew Agreements and Official Log Books contain both vital data and broader information about lives (and deaths) at sea while crews transported cargoes and passengers around the world in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
