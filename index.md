# Maritime History workshops

We are a group of three maritime historians who wish to provide a forum for emerging and new scholars of maritime history to meet and discuss ideas, share their research, and benefit from advice of senior researchers, maritime specialists, museum and archival researchers, and journal editors.

We work in partnership with the [Maritime History Archive](https://mha.mun.ca/) in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador.

Our program runs concurrently with the academic year and in the past we have met once a month on the first Tuesday at 2:00pm Newfoundland Time (UTC-3:30/-2:30). We are hosted by the MHA on [Webex](https://www.webex.com/downloads.html).

Plans for the 2025-2026 academic year are on-going and the call for participation will go out in late July or early August. The call will be posted here and distributed via maritime history networks.

_Our latest program, the New Horizons Workshop, has concluded._
