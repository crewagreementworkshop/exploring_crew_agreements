Maritime History Workshops was founded in 2022 by Drs. Valerie Burton, Meaghan Walker, and Kristof Loockx, in partnership with the [Maritime History Archive](https://mha.mun.ca/) at Memorial University of Newfoundland. Since that time we have hosted four successful events.

### [Exploring British Imperial Crew Agreements and Official Logs, 1863-1972](https://crewagreementworkshop.github.io/exploring_crew_agreements/expcrewagreements)

**February 3 & 17, 2022**

Exploring British Imperial Crew Agreements was a two-part series that explored the projects and potential of the Maritime History Archive. We heard interesting talks from volunteers and academics who are committed to this collection. Topics ranged from the [CLIP project](https://www.crewlist.org.uk/) that improves the accessibility of the MHA, to topics on medicine, women's history, material culture, Indigenous history, and medicine.

### [Postcolonial Uses for the Primary Sources of British Imperial Merchant Seafarers in the 19th & 20th Centuries Roundtable](https://crewagreementworkshop.github.io/exploring_crew_agreements/postcolonial)

**March 8, 2022**

_How might researchers better explore primary sources to write post-colonial maritime histories?_ This roundtable brought together scholars of British-Asiatic and British-African merchant seafarers to discuss the challenges of finding these workers in British imperial records.

### [Unsettling Orthodoxies in Merchant Seafaring History (Post-1750)](https://maritimeworkshops.com/orthodoxies/)

**September 2023 to April 2024**

Our first monthly meetings encompassing the academic year, this series of workshops asked emerging scholars to discuss how their work was challenging maritime orthodoxies, whether it was through urbanity, materialism, archival and fictional narratives, indigeneity, environmental studies, or even other disciplines such as anthropology and archaeology.

### [New Horizons - Workshops for Emerging Scholars in Maritime History](https://maritimeworkshops.com/newhorizons/)

**September 2024 to April 2025**

The second workshop series in the academic year 2024-25 focused on bringing established scholars and others to discuss issues, concerns, and advice with emerging scholars on a range of topics. These discussion sessions featured topics such as grappling with historical arguments, publication, engaging the public, networking, and digital research. These sessions were attended by about 20-30 emerging scholars from the US and Canada, Europe, Israel, and South America.
