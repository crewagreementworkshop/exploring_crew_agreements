**Meet & Greet**

This will be an information and consultation session about the format and content of further sessions and will include a roundtable meet & greet. You might prepare for it by:
-  giving some thought to how our interests are best served as a group sharing the aim of better explaining our activities as researchers whose understandings of history have been shaped by the seas.
- having ready a few auto-biographical details
- ensuring that you have a functioning internet link through [Webex](https://www.webex.com/downloads.html) using the [Webex test meeting](https://www.webex.com/test-meeting.html)
