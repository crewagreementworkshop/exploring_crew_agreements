### Fall 2024 Schedule

**Meet & Greet**

24 September, 2024 - Tuesday at 2pm Newfoundland Time (UTC -2:30)

The workshop's first meeting, an information and consultation session about the format and content of future workshops. We conducted a roundtable meet & greet and learned of everyone's interesting and important work.

**Historical Truth and ‘Who We Are’: A Discussion of How Arguments are Made in [Maritime] History**

8 October, 2024 - Tuesday at 2pm Newfoundland Time (UTC -2:30)

We discussed the roles of objectivity and activism in historical work. As a basis, we asked that participants listen to BBC journalist Jeremy Bowen’s [‘Frontlines of Journalism’, Episode 4: ‘Rules and Habits’](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m001jl28) (c.15 minutes).

**‘Publish Early, Publish Often’: What advice does a maritime journal editor have for emerging scholars?**

For this session, Dr. Michelle Turner, editor of *[Mainsheet](https://www.mainsheet.mysticseaport.org/about)*, joined us. She discussed the ups and downs of publishing articles in academic journals with examples from her editorial experience.

### Winter 2025 Schedule (Concluded Sessions Only)

**Maritime Scholarship in the Public Eye**

7 January, 2025 - Tuesday at 2pm Newfoundland Time (UTC -3:30)

In the new year we were be joined by Dr. Sara Caputo, who recently appeared on the BBC Radio 4 program _Thinking Allowed_, and Dr. Lucas Haasis, research coordinator and PR manager of the Prize Papers Project. Our guests shared with us how they got involved with these opportunities and took questions on how to bring academic work to a broader audience.

We listened to [_Thinking Allowed_: Sea Travel](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0023ydj) prior to our meeting and visited the [Prize Papers website](https://www.prizepapers.de/).

**Academic Networking in Maritime Scholarship: Using Shared Resources and Participating in Community**

4 February, 2025 - Tuesday at 2pm Newfoundland Time (UTC -3:30)

For this session, we welcomed Dr. Caroline Marris and Prof. Em. Lex Heerma van Voss, who shared their practical experiences with networking.

Dr. Caroline Marris is a Research Program Administrator at Drexel University and Co-Editor of the H-Maritime Network at H-Net, a crucial platform for maritime scholars. With experience as both a scholar and an administrator, she has valuable insights into building and maintaining professional networks.

Prof. Em. Lex Heerma van Voss is a fellow at the International Institute of Social History in Amsterdam and the former director of the Huygens Institute for History and Culture of the Netherlands. His distinguished career provides a wealth of experience on how networking has shaped his professional journey and collaborative research.

**Uses of Digital Research with Guest Dr. Margaret Schotte**

4 March, 2025 - Tuesday at 2pm Newfoundland Time (UTC -3:30)

In this session we were joined by Dr. Margaret Schotte, an associate professor of history at York University in Toronto, Canada, whose research brings together the history of information, science, and maritime history.

Prof. Schotte leads the “Sailing with the French” team, a SSHRC-funded project that aims to visualize more than 1,300 French East India Company voyages. Her international team is investigating technical knowledge, labour, and race in the 18th-century Indian Ocean world. She will be presenting on some of the challenges involved in extracting standardized data from 18th-century crew manifests, as well as the exciting cartographic possibilities offered by these rich archival documents.

 **Explaining Ourselves: Concluding the New Horizons Sessions**

 1 April, 2025 - Tuesday at 2pm Newfoundland Time (UTC -2:30)

 This year, we explored the multiple and diverse professional demands of "explaining ourselves" as maritime historians, with a particular focus on historical truth, publishing, maritime scholarship in the public eye, networking and digital mapping. We are deeply grateful to our guests for enriching our discussions and contributing to this journey.

 For our final session, we held a roundtable discussion to reflect on the key themes from previous workshops. In this way, each participant had the opportunity to briefly reintroduce their research and discuss how the various topics covered throughout the program might have made a difference to career strategies for “explaining ourselves” to the different audiences and agencies routinely encountered in our professional lives (publishers, grant-awarding agencies, job recruiters, the public and last but not least, our students).

 _Thank you to our guests and participants for attending the sessions and thanks as well to our collaborators at the Maritime History Archive._
