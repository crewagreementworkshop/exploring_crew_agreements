title: Call for Topics, Winter 2024
permalink: /orthodoxies/

Maritime History Workshops is soliciting proposals for two topics to discuss in Winter 2024. The workshops will follow the same or similar format of Fall 2023:

- First Meeting, January: Meet & Greet with old and new attendees
- Second Meeting, February: First Topic Discussion
- Third Meeting, March: Second Topic Discussion

**Our purpose**: discussion of the sources, concepts, and methods that inform us about past maritime populations.

The topic should be an orthodoxy, problem, or new approach in Maritime History that we might either leave behind or forget at our peril. Your proposal should include at least one additional person to act as topic specialist as you both present the topic to the wider group. We encourage leadership from graduate students, early career researchers, and contingent scholars.

The meetings have been set at 90 minutes and in order to give all attendees an opportunity for contributing, the number of people accepted as attendees will be set around 15 people. This includes 2-3 staff from the Maritime History Archive, members of Maritime History Workshops, and the four topic specialists.

Meetings will be hosted by the MHA via Webex and will not be recorded.

Please get in touch with Dr. Meaghan Walker at [infomarworkshops@gmail.com](mailto:informarworkshops@gmail.com) with any questions or to submit your proposal.

**We are:**
- Meaghan Walker: Independent Researcher, St Johnâ€™s, Newfoundland, Canada
- Kristof Loockx: Postdoctoral Researcher, University of Antwerp, Belgium.
- Valerie Burton: Emeritus Professor of Maritime History, Memorial University, Canada

**Our hosts**: the [Maritime History Archive](https://mha.mun.ca/mha/) of Memorial University of Newfoundland. See below for other events of this kind the archive has hosted online.
