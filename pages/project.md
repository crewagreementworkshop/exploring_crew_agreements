This series of workshops stem from a broader discussion of the future and function of the British Crew Agreements and Official Logs in archives in Britain and in Newfoundland. A massive collection spanning over 100 years, the Crew Agreements and Logs are extremely dense documents of historical importance for a wide range of scholars, most commonly maritime historians and family history researchers. This series of workshops, however, shows the vast uses of Crew Agreements and Logs as significant sources of social and cultural history that becomes more viable as digitization and transcription projects give hints to their contents.
