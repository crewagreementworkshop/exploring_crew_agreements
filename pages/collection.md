The collection items on this website are from the collection of the [Maritime History Archive](https://mha.mun.ca/mha/), St. John's, NL, Canada. More information about these documents, including their provenance, contents, and their broader history of the workforce they track, can be found at [More Than a List of Crew](https://mha.mun.ca/mha/mlc/).

These records were used in presentations for the [Exploring Crew Agreements Workshop](https://maritimeworkshops.com/expcrewagreements/) and the [Postcolonial Uses for British Merchant Shipping Primary Sources Workshop](https://maritimeworkshops.com/postcolonial/).
